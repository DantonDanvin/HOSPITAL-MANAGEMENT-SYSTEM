Hospital Management System is a project made with C language and uses TUI(called as Terminal User Interface).

The project's capabilities include registration of patients, storing their details into the system, maintaining the patients database and providing information regarding bed availability in the hospital which has a capacity of 1000 beds. Also the project will generate a unique id for every patient which is useful for easy retrieval of the details of every patient. It includes a facility to check the current status of each database. Users can search availability of beds and check for the availability of a patient for there particular id. Few features which my project includes are :

Add New Patient's
Edit a Patient's
Display a Patient's
Delete a Patient's
Display Entire Patient Database
Total Number of Patients
In this project I've used OOPS concept along with data structure (Doubly Linkedlist).
